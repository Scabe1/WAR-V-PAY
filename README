#MLB Player Salary vs WAR Analysis
##Author
Gabriel Garcia  
Data Science Undergraduate – Arizona State University

This project analyzes the relationship between MLB player salaries and their Wins Above Replacement (WAR) to identify inefficiencies in player compensation.

---

## Project Objective
To evaluate whether player salaries align with on-field performance, and to identify potentially overpaid or underpaid players using WAR as a performance benchmark.

---

## Dataset
- Sample of 200 MLB players
- Features include:
  - Player salary
  - WAR (Wins Above Replacement)

Dataset source: compiled CSV dataset for academic analysis.

---

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to:
  - Examine salary distributions
  - Analyze WAR distributions
  - Identify outliers
- Visualization of salary vs. WAR relationships using Matplotlib

---

## Key Findings
- Salary and WAR show a weak-to-moderate correlation
- Several players appear statistically overpaid relative to their WAR
- High salary does not consistently translate to high performance

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in `war_v_pay/`
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis

---

## Future Improvements I plan to Implement
- Expand dataset to multiple seasons
- Add regression modeling, allowing age to play a big role in the analysis
- Normalize salary by position
- Incorporate additional performance metrics
